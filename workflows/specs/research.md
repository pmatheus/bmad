| `{user_name}` | `.bmad/config.yaml` | Author name for research document | `"Jane Analyst"` |
| `{bmad_folder}` | `.bmad/config.yaml` | BMAD installation location | `.bmad` |
| `{project_name}` | `.bmad/config.yaml` | Project name | `"AI-Powered CRM"` |
| `{current_date}` | System date | Current date for documentation | `2025-11-18` |
| `{research_focus}` | User input | Research focus areas (market/competitive/technical/user) | `"market,competitive"` |
| `{output_file}` | Generated | Research document output path | `{documentation_dir}/research.md` |

**Configuration file location:** `.bmad/config.yaml`

**Required input files:**
- `.bmad/config.yaml` - Project configuration

**Optional input files:**
- `.bmad/product-brief.md` - Product vision and context (highly recommended)
- `.bmad/brainstorm.md` - Initial brainstorming notes

## Instructions

### 1. Load Configuration

Read project configuration from `.bmad/config.yaml`:

```javascript
{
  documentation_dir: string,      // Where docs are stored (e.g., .bmad)
  user_name: string,              // Author name
  bmad_folder: string,            // BMAD install location
  project_name: string            // Project name
}
```

### 2. Validate Workflow Readiness

**Check for workflow status file:**

1. Check if `.bmad/bmm-workflow-status.yaml` exists

**If status file NOT found (standalone mode):**

Set `standalone_mode = true`

Display: "Research workflow can run standalone or as part of BMM workflow. Running in standalone mode - great for exploring your market opportunity!"

**If status file found (workflow mode):**

1. Load COMPLETE file: `.bmad/bmm-workflow-status.yaml`
2. Parse `workflow_status` section
3. Check status of "research" workflow
4. Get `project_level` from metadata
5. Find first non-completed workflow

**Validation checks:**

**If project_level < 2:**
```
9 Research workflow is optional for Level 0-1 (Quick Flow)

Your project is Level {project_level} (Quick Flow). Research is valuable but optional.

Continue with research anyway?
- Yes, conduct research (recommended for strategic clarity)
- No, skip to tech-spec or PRD
```

**If research already completed:**
```
9 Research workflow already completed

Status shows research was completed on {completion_date}.

Options:
- Continue to update/refresh research
- Skip to next workflow: {next_workflow_name}
```

### 3. Load Context Documents

**Attempt to load product brief (if exists):**

Check for: `.bmad/product-brief.md`

**If found:**
- Load entire document
- Extract: Problem statement, target users, solution vision
- Use as anchor for research focus

**If not found:**
```
9 No product brief found

Research will be more exploratory without product brief context.

Recommendation: Run `/bmad:phase-1:product-brief` first for focused research.

Proceed with open-ended research?
- Yes, proceed (exploratory research)
- No, create product brief first (recommended)
```

**Attempt to load brainstorming notes (if exists):**

Check for: `.bmad/brainstorm.md`

**If found:**

```
’ Solution: This is OK for exploratory research. For focused research, run `/bmad:phase-1:product-brief` first.

**Research scope too broad:**
```
  Research scope may be too broad for single report
```
’ Solution:
1. Prioritize most critical research areas
2. Start with market + competitive (most common)
3. Run follow-up research for additional areas
4. Use `/bmad:phase-1:domain-research` for deep dives

**Limited sources available:**
```
9 Limited public information available for this market
```
’ Solution:
- Note confidence levels as "Low" for affected findings
- Flag need for primary research (interviews, surveys)
- Identify assumptions and validate with stakeholders
- Consider expert consultations or paid reports

**Conflicting information found:**
```
  Conflicting data found across sources
```
’ Solution:
- Document all sources and their claims
- Note discrepancies explicitly
- Use most recent and credible sources
- Indicate confidence level as "Medium"
- Recommend follow-up validation

**WebSearch not available:**
```
  WebSearch tool not available in this environment
```
’ Solution:
- Use WebFetch tool for specific URLs
- Rely on existing knowledge (note as limitation)
- Flag areas requiring manual research
- Provide research questions for user to investigate

**Research takes too long:**
```
ñ Research is taking longer than expected
```
’ Solution:
- Analyst should provide periodic progress updates
- Focus on critical questions first
- Time-box research activities
- Document what was covered and what needs follow-up

- Technical Options Evaluated: 5 platforms (HIPAA-compliant video, EHR integration)
- Risks Identified: 12 (regulatory, market, technical, operational)
- Recommendations: 11 strategic recommendations

**Recommendation:** Go (with significant compliance investment required)

**Rationale:** Market opportunity is massive and growing rapidly. Compliance is complex but well-understood. Success requires excellence in regulatory adherence and user experience - both non-negotiable.

**Next Steps:**
1. Review detailed research at: .bmad/research.md
2. Engage HIPAA compliance consultant before PRD
3. Budget for compliance infrastructure and audits
4. Run `/bmad:phase-2:prd` with strong compliance focus
5. Plan for state-by-state licensing strategy

**Areas Flagged for Follow-Up:**
- State licensing requirements (needs legal analysis per state)
- Insurance reimbursement landscape (needs payer partnerships)
- Prescribing regulations by state (needs detailed regulatory research)

**Quality Indicators:**
- Source Recency: 94% within last 2 years (regulatory docs current)
- Source Credibility: High (HHS, state agencies, industry analysts)
- Data Completeness: 100% critical questions answered, 85% overall

  Research Complete - Reconsider Project Direction

**Project Details:**
- Project Name: Blockchain-Based Social Network
- Research Document: .bmad/research.md
- Focus Areas: Market, Competitive, Technical, User
- Author: Jane Analyst
- Date: 2025-11-18

**Research Scope:**
- Focus Areas: All areas (comprehensive)
- Key Questions: 18 questions investigated
- Sources Consulted: 27
- Pages Generated: ~16 pages

**Key Findings Summary:**
1. Market: Crowded with 12+ competitors, declining user growth (-15% YoY)
2. Users: Low willingness to pay, strong privacy concerns, high churn
3. Technical: Blockchain adds cost without clear user benefit

**Research Metrics:**
- Market Size (TAM): $4.2B (declining from $5.1B in 2023)
- Competitors Analyzed: 12 (saturated market)
- User Personas Created: 3 (all show low engagement)
- Technical Options Evaluated: 4 blockchain platforms
- Risks Identified: 9 (mostly high probability + high impact)
- Recommendations: 3 (all suggest pivoting)

**Recommendation:** No-Go

**Rationale:** Market is oversaturated with declining growth. Users show low willingness to pay and high churn. Blockchain adds technical complexity and cost without addressing core user needs. Multiple well-funded competitors have failed in past 2 years.

**Critical Concerns:**
- Market declining 15% YoY with no reversal signals
- User acquisition cost ($47) exceeds lifetime value ($23)
- 8 of 12 competitors have shut down or pivoted (2022-2024)
- Blockchain infrastructure cost 3-5x higher than traditional tech
- No clear value proposition differentiating from existing solutions

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Review detailed research at: .bmad/research.md
2. Consider pivot options:
   - Remove blockchain, focus on niche community (gaming, creators)
   - Build privacy-focused messaging (different market)
   - Enterprise collaboration tool (B2B vs B2C)
3. Conduct follow-up research on pivot directions
4. Reassess problem worth solving

**If Proceeding Anyway:**
- Acknowledge high risk of failure (>80% based on comp analysis)
- Secure runway for 18+ months (longer sales cycles)
- Plan for aggressive pivots based on early data
- Focus on specific niche (not broad social network)
